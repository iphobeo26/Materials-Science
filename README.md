# Materials-Science
In this notebook I try to put all the calculation from the Willey materials science and engineering handbook.
The calculcation were written in python notebook in order to imporve my skills in computation program and understanding the usage of computing in materials science.
This is my first notebook I solved a problem to calculate the average of an atoms based of its presence.
The code is applicable for calculating numbers of atoms and summariezed the average of its total.

Please have a look and I welcome to any suggestion.
Enjoy!
