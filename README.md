# Materials-Science
In this notebook I try to put all the calculation exercise from the Willey materials science and engineering handbook.
The calculations were written in jupyter notebook to improve my skills in computational programming and understanding the usage of scientific computing in materials science.

Please have a look and I welcome to any suggestion.
Enjoy!
