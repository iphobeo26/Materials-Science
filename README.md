# Materials-Science
In this notebook I try to put all the calculation from the Willey materials science and engineering handbook.
The calculations were written in jupyter notebook to improve my skills in computational programing and understanding the usage of scientific computing in materials science.

Please have a look and I welcome to any suggestion.
Enjoy!
